"I usually open Vim with vim . which pops me right into the netrw view. From here, I can create new files or directories:

% – Create new file from netrw
d – Create new directory from netrw
If you’re in a buffer and want to hop back to the file tree, just use :e . and you’ll be placed in a view of the current working directory. From here, you can browse and create a new file or folder exactly where you want it."

There are comments added by me throughout this whole config. Look at those for some more details on the specifics of the lua setup.
